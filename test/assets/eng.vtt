{\an5}SWORD ART ONLINE THE MOVIE -PROGRESSIVE-
ARIA OF A STARLESS NIGHT

15
00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:44.933
Good morning, Miss Asuna.

16
00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.394
Good morning, Ms. Sata.

17
00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:50.147
Your breakfast is ready.

18
00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.232
Your father is at the table today as well.

19
00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.609
Really? Thanks!

20
00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:03.410
Morning!

21
00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.454
Morning, Brother.

22
00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.247
Morning, Asuna.

23
00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:11.084
Morning!
It's unusual you're still home, Dad.

24
00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:13.795
Well, you're late.

25
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.466
Didn't I tell you to be at the table by 6:557

26
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:20.635
I'm sorry.

27
00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.140
How's school?

28
00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:26.600
It's going well.

29
00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.603
I got perfect scores on my math
and English midterms,

30
00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:33.440
and I might be one of the top-ranking students
they're announcing today.

31
00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.359
How could you not rank near the top
on your exams?

32
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:41.615
Hardly any kids at your school are serious
about studying at this time of year.

33
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.826
I got an A-ranking
on my cram school exams, too.

34
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.454
My teacher says if I keep this up,
I'll be fine.

35
00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:48.580
So no worries.

36
00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.541
There you go,
letting your guard down.

37
00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:56.797
Now, now, it's fine as long as she's doing well.

38
00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.466
That reminds me.
Koichiro...

39
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.843
About your overseas business trip—

40
00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.804
Everything is all ready.

41
00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:06.765
Remember, it's part
of the executive candidate selection process.

42
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.558
So no cutting loose,
all right?

43
00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.227
You don't have to tell me.

44
00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:11.937
I'll be on my best behavior at night, too.

45
00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.564
Don't even think about bringing
that NerveGear with you.

46
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.900
- Oh, why didn't I think of that?
- Asuna, hurry up and eat.

47
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:19.444
- You'll be late.
- You really are something else, you know that?

48
00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.531
Thank you for this meal.

49
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.119
I'll be going now.

50
00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:29.371
You have a good day, miss.

51
00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.873
Hey, Asuna!

52
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.834
You heading out already?

53
00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.001
Yes.

54
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.630
You're doing great,
you know.

55
00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.382
So don't push yourself too hard, okay?

56
00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:43.468
Right. I know.

57
00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.732
Hey, listen!
The score I got today was my personal best!

58
00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:00.569
The parts Ms. Yuuki helped us out with
came out on the exam!

59
00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:02.737
I'll follow you anywhere!

60
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:04.656
Well, I'm glad that I was able to help.

61
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.659
I saw your ranking, too.
Amazing again!

62
00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.620
I saw it, too! You've never fallen out
of the top ten since we started here!

63
00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.163
Why are we not surprised, right?

64
00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.791
Well, someone did get better grades than me.

65
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.752
Hey, I hear you're leaving our school system
after junior high, right?

66
00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.296
What, is that true?

67
00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:22.257
Our high school's pretty top-notch,
too, so, wow!

68
00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:24.426
It's what my parents want.

69
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:29.097
I can stay here till junior high, but I have to
take the entrance exams to get into high school.

70
00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.015
Wow...

71
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.685
Listen to you!
Heading down the path of the super-elite.

72
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.353
You're awesome!

73
00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:38.648
Good morning!

74
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.325
Good morning!

75
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.704
- Morning.
- Morning.

76
00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.164
Morning!

77
00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:00.337
- Morning!
- Morning!

78
00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:03.840
Ms. Tozawa was number one again
this time, huh?

79
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.885
Yeah. Wonder what you'd have to do
to get great grades like her?

80
00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:07.969
Why don't you ask her?

81
00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:12.223
Not happening!
Just talking to her makes me nervous!

82
00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.185
You and Ms. Tozawa are close,
aren't you, Ms. Yuuki?

83
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.978
- What?
- Lucky you!

84
00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.564
I guess you get along
since you're both top students?

85
00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:22.067
That's not really what it's like with us.

86
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:25.028
But I bet you two are always discussing
really complex topics.

87
00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:28.239
Like the outlook for Japan,
or global issues and stuff?

88
00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:19.874
See you, Ms. Yuuki!

89
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.876
Right, see you.

90
00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:39.059
I'm ready to end this now.

91
00:08:39.184 --> 00:08:40.061
What?

92
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.190
I lost again!

93
00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:49.362
You're way too focused on defense, Asuna.
You need to attack more.

94
00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:53.324
But the commands for my special moves
are so complicated!

95
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.415
I can't believe you can move
your fingers that fast, Misumi.

96
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.584
Well, I'm constantly training.

97
00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.210
You mean you play at home, too?

98
00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:06.129
And at the arcade, too.

99
00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:07.839
Oh...

100
00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:13.053
{\an8}MISUMI TOZAWA

101
00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:17.015
<i>That person's number one again.</i>

102
00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:25.315
<i>Misumi Tozawa.</i>

103
00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.362
And she wins again!

104
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:32.864
How many players has she overtaken?

105
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.116
Hey, is that a record for consecutive wins?

106
00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:37.577
And that player's a girl, no less!

107
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.704
<i>Come on, come on, come on!</i>

108
00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:41.289
<i>Come on, come on, come on!</i>

109
00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.457
Ms. Tozawa?

110
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.008
Um...

111
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.680
You should've seen your face then!

112
00:09:57.806 --> 00:10:02.352
I really slipped up. Who knew
they were live streaming it outside the shop?

113
00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:08.024
Why should you hide it? It's not that uncommon
for a girl to be into gaming now, right?

114
00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:11.736
Our school's different.
It's one thing if you're in the elementary course.

115
00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:13.404
You really think so?

116
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.865
You're the only opponent I need, Asuna.

117
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.408
As weak as I am?

118
00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:18.535
Yeah.

119
00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:26.000
Oh, that reminds me.
Hey, Asuna...

120
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:29.796
NerveGear?

121
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:30.547
Yeah.

122
00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.340
What about it?

123
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:38.221
They just released a full-scale VRMMORPG
for the NerveGear.

124
00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.683
Sword Art Online.

125
00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.936
Right. "SAO" for short.

126
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.272
Hey, want to try it with me?

127
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.401
I'd like to see you over there, too.

128
00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.696
But I don't have a NerveGear, so...

129
00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:58.950
Your father runs RCT, so shouldn't you be able
to pester him for one?

130
00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.708
I don't see that happening till after
my entrance exams.

131
00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.669
Asuna, don't you think you're pushing
yourself too hard?

132
00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.716
You have to take a break sometimes
if you want to avoid burnout.

133
00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:17.093
I do go on breaks,
you know.

134
00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:19.345
No, it's still not enough.

135
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.055
So let's have one more match.

136
00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:25.059
Well, I guess I can do that.

137
00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.397
Hey, but first...

138
00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:32.400
I noticed that your hair seemed
to be getting in your way,

139
00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:33.526
so I'll tie it back for you.

140
00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:35.111
Turn your head.

141
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.238
O-Okay.

142
00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.410
This feels kind of weird.

143
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.661
Don't move, okay?

144
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.414
If I braided it in the back,
it would be even cuter.

145
00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:48.541
I'm sure you'd look great.

146
00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:50.293
<i>A break, huh?</i>

147
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:54.547
All right, I'm done.
Look at me.

148
00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.759
What, you're taking a picture?

149
00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:00.261
It's my masterpiece.

150
00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:01.512
I'll send it to you.

151
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.726
{\an8}NOVEMBER 6, 2022

152
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.105
Brother?
I'm coming in.

153
00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:18.404
Huh? Oh, right.
He's off on his business trip today.

154
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.749
Hey, is this...

155
00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.043
Sword Art Online?

156
00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:36.172
So he bought it.

157
00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:39.300
Then right now,
Misumi must be...

158
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.595
<i>I'd like to see you over there, too.</i>

159
00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:50.144
Brother, I'm going to borrow this
for just a little while, okay?

160
00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:05.493
Um...

161
00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:08.538
Link start!

162
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.966
<i>Welcome to Sword Art Online!</i>

163
00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:22.802
<i>Please start by entering your name.</i>

164
00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:27.390
<i>Name?
Wait, she means mine, right?</i>

165
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.102
A-SU-NA.

166
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.481
<i>Next, we're going to create your avatar.</i>

167
00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:38.943
<i>Gender, hairstyle, skin color, build...</i>

168
00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:41.821
<i>Please choose whatever you like,
and adjust the details.</i>

169
00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:45.199
Wh-What is this?
What am I supposed to do?

170
00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:46.701
Huh?

171
00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:52.498
"You may also base your avatar
on a photo of yourself."

172
00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:54.250
I think I'll go with this one.

173
00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.210
<i>Whoa!</i>

174
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.588
Brother...

175
00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:17.774
<i>And now we're going to transport you to the
game's starting point, the Town of Beginnings.</i>

<i>We hope that you enjoy your adventure
at the floating castle, Aincrad, to the fullest.</i>

177
00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:40.004
{\an8}FLOOR 1
TOWN OF BEGINNINGS

178
00:14:57.647 --> 00:15:00.274
I'm... inside the game now?

179
00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:10.701
Amazing... it's like the real thing!

180
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.203
I wonder if Misumi's around somewhere—

181
00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.455
Welcome, Madam Swordswoman.

182
00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:17.083
Is there something I
can help you with?

183
00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:17.792
What?

184
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:21.462
This is the central plaza
in the Town of Beginnings.

185
00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:25.466
The shopping district where you'll find weapon
and equipment shops is that way.

186
00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:28.594
Um... actually... you see...

187
00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:30.388
The thing is...

188
00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.183
Well, I'm looking for a friend!

189
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.731
A friend, you say?

190
00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:43.276
Yes! Her name is Misumi—

191
00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:45.820
And she's the same age as me.

192
00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:48.281
She's about this tall—

193
00:15:48.406 --> 00:15:51.742
There is no player registered under
the name of Misumi.

194
00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:53.870
But I know she must be here.

195
00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:57.707
I ran the search again,
but there is no one by that name.

196
00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:01.586
Her last name is Tozawa.
That's T-O-Z-A-W-A.

197
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:04.505
- I'm sure she's around here somewhere!
- Why is that girl chatting with an NPC?

198
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.965
Newbie.

199
00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:10.678
I said her name is Tozawa Misu—

200
00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:12.430
Hold up!

201
00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:21.022
What are you doing here?

202
00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:22.773
Ah?

203
00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:28.112
Oh, it's because of this?

204
00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:30.907
Help! Let me go!

205
00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:31.908
It's me, it's me.

206
00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.034
Wh-Who are you?

207
00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.411
- It's Misumi.
- I don't know anyone named Misumi—

208
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:41.834
I'm Misumi.

209
00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.002
That voice...

210
00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:46.380
Oh, but you're not the one I'm looking for.

211
00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.299
That would be a girl named Misumi Tozawa!

212
00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:50.301
Misumi is spelled with the characters

213
00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:52.845
- for "deep" and "clear," and—
- Listen, you—

214
00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:57.308
Stop yelling out my real name!

215
00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:07.068
You should've given me a heads-up
if you were coming here.

216
00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:10.445
Sorry. It was totally unplanned.

217
00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:15.159
Hey, it's sweet.
Tastes like the real thing...

218
00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:20.205
You really are Misumi, aren't you?

219
00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:21.790
I go by Mito here.

220
00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:23.334
What, Mito?

221
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:26.253
Why do you look like that?

222
00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:29.674
Because this is the type
of character that I like.

223
00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:33.094
Well, I have to say you're like
a whole different person.

224
00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:34.971
I would never think you were Misumi!

225
00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:37.390
That's Mito, not Misumi!

226
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.978
You're way more ballsy than me, Asuna.

227
00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.355
Using your real name for your player name.

228
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.941
And your avatar may as well be the real you.

229
00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.694
Well, I didn't know what I was doing.

230
00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.237
Seriously...

231
00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:54.448
But I'm glad I got to see you over here, too.

232
00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:57.326
Yeah! I'm glad I got to see you, too.

233
00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:01.372
All right, want to get going now?

234
00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:02.873
Where to?

235
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.752
I'm going to clue you in to the best part
of this game.

236
00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:10.464
You equip yourself,
and battle monsters.

237
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.633
What? B-Battle them?

238
00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:16.137
No worries. There are only weak ones
around this town.

239
00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:17.722
But I'm no gamer—

240
00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:22.101
Unlike in fighting games,
you actually move your body in battle.

241
00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:25.021
You're a good athlete, Asuna,
so you'll get used to it in no time.

242
00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:26.981
I'm not sure about that.

243
00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:28.566
But before we start...

244
00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.528
Let's take a walk through the town.

245
00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:35.281
Because that's the best part of this game.

246
00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:39.410
How many bests can there be?

247
00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:21.827
You must be hungry.
Let me take you to a great place I know.

248
00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:23.579
It's right around the corner from here—

249
00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:27.500
Hey, this game was just launched today, right?

250
00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:28.959
What about it?

251
00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:31.712
No, it's just that you really know
a lot about it.

252
00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.923
Because I've been prepping for it
for a long time.

253
00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:35.299
Prepping?

254
00:19:36.467 --> 00:19:38.719
Oh, I've got to head home now!

255
00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:39.595
What about dinner?

256
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.056
Thanks for the offer,
but I'll have to take a rain check.

257
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.849
I see. Too bad.

258
00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:45.351
What are you going to do, Mito?

259
00:19:45.476 --> 00:19:47.103
I'm staying.

260
00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.772
Since there are still things I need to do.

261
00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:54.193
Thanks.
I had a good time today.

262
00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:55.736
I'll see you at school tomorrow, okay?

263
00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.697
Will I see you here again, too?

264
00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.574
Sure. I'll borrow this
from my brother and log in!

265
00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:03.244
Huh?

266
00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:04.120
What's wrong?

267
00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:07.581
Hey, what do you have to do
to leave this game?

268
00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:10.501
There should be a logout button.

269
00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:14.004
Logout... logout...

270
00:20:14.505 --> 00:20:16.090
I can't find it.

271
00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:17.842
That's ridicu—

272
00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:20.511
There isn't one.

273
00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:25.141
That's weird.
The UI design's the same as before.

274
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.209
Are we supposed to report malfunctions, too?

275
00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:54.378
Forced teleportation?

276
00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.339
What on earth is happening?

277
00:20:57.798 --> 00:20:58.924
Mito?

278
00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:00.801
Hey... up there!

279
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.464
Is that the game master?

280
00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:39.924
Why doesn't he have a face?

281
00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:41.133
What event is this?

282
00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:50.226
Attention, players.
Welcome to my world.

283
00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:53.479
My name is Akihiko Kayaba.

284
00:21:53.604 --> 00:21:57.525
As of this moment, I am the only person able
to control this world.

285
00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.485
Akihiko Kayaba?

286
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.195
Hey, who is that?

287
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.572
He's the guy who developed this game.

288
00:22:03.697 --> 00:22:10.538
I'm sure you've already noticed that the logout
button is missing from the main menu.

289
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.917
But this is not a defect in the game.

290
00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.503
I repeat...

291
00:22:17.628 --> 00:22:18.879
It is not a defect in the game,

292
00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:21.966
but a rightful feature of Sword Art Online.

293
00:22:22.716 --> 00:22:26.345
You cannot log out of SAO of your own volition.

294
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:32.142
And no one on the outside can shut down
or remove the NerveGear.

295
00:22:32.268 --> 00:22:38.274
Should this be attempted, the transmitter inside
the NerveGear will emit a powerful microwave,

296
00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:42.653
destroying your brain
and thus ending your life.

297
00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:48.617
Unfortunately, as of now, there have been
several instances in which players' friends

298
00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:51.662
and families have ignored this warning,

299
00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:55.082
and attempted to forcibly remove
the NerveGear.

300
00:22:55.541 --> 00:23:03.382
As a result, 213 players have exited permanently,
from both Aincrad and the real world.

301
00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:08.762
As you can see, news organizations across
the world are reporting on this situation,

302
00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:11.307
including the multiple deaths.

303
00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:18.105
Thus, you can assume that the danger of a
NerveGear being removed has been reduced.

304
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.401
I would like you all to rest assured
and apply yourselves to clearing the game.

305
00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:25.696
But I want you to be sure
to keep this in mind.

306
00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:30.159
There is no longer any function
to revive someone within the game.

307
00:23:30.284 --> 00:23:36.165
The instant your HP drops to zero,
your avatars will vanish forever.

308
00:23:38.459 --> 00:23:39.710
And at the same time...

309
00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:42.046
...your brains will be destroyed
by the NerveGear.

310
00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:49.511
There is only one condition
for your escape.

311
00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:52.389
All you have to do is complete this game.

312
00:23:54.308 --> 00:23:59.855
You are presently on the lowest floor
of Aincrad, Floor 1.

313
00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.982
If you make your way through the dungeon
and defeat the Floor Boss,

314
00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:05.235
you may advance to the next level.

315
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:09.198
Defeat the final boss on Floor 100,
and you will clear the game.

316
00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:14.662
D-Don't just make stuff up!

317
00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:17.748
Clear... all 100 floors?

318
00:24:17.873 --> 00:24:19.208
That's impossible!

319
00:24:19.333 --> 00:24:22.086
Even the beta testers never made
it that high, right?

320
00:24:23.379 --> 00:24:29.885
Now then, finally, I've provided you all
with a gift in your item storage.

321
00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.971
Please see for yourselves.

322
00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:39.853
{\an8}MIRROR

323
00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:39.853
A mirror?

324
00:24:45.985 --> 00:24:47.111
Mito!

325
00:24:58.247 --> 00:24:59.957
Asuna!
Are you all right?

326
00:25:00.374 --> 00:25:01.834
Um, yeah.

327
00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:04.795
Huh?
Are you... Misumi?

328
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.506
Hey, I told you,
it's Mito over here!

329
00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:08.924
B-But...

330
00:25:10.926 --> 00:25:12.052
Huh? Who are you?

331
00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:13.178
And who are you?

332
00:25:13.303 --> 00:25:14.555
You're a guy?

333
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.390
You were lying about being 177

334
00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:19.351
Why? Why would he do this in the first place?

335
00:25:19.935 --> 00:25:21.895
Akihiko Kayaba...

336
00:25:22.438 --> 00:25:25.691
Right now, you must all be wondering, "Why?"

337
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:30.279
Why would Akihiko Kayaba, developer
of Sword Art Online and the NerveGear

338
00:25:30.404 --> 00:25:32.948
do such a thing?

339
00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:36.326
My goal has already been achieved.

340
00:25:36.452 --> 00:25:39.705
I created Sword Art Online for one reason...

341
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.916
To create this world and enjoy watching it.

342
00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:47.546
And now,
all is complete.

343
00:25:48.714 --> 00:25:54.053
This concludes the tutorial for the official
Sword Art Online launch.

344
00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:57.014
I have one last warning for you.

345
00:25:57.264 --> 00:26:00.267
This may be a game,
but it's not something you play.

346
00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:04.188
I wish you luck, players.

347
00:26:23.624 --> 00:26:27.127
No... No!

348
00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:29.546
- S-Screw you!
- Let us out!

349
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:30.756
Let us out of here!

350
00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:36.887
I can't stay here.
I have to meet someone after this!

351
00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:40.265
Is this... reality?

352
00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:42.810
Let me out!
Let me out of here!

353
00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:44.269
No! Somebody save us!

354
00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:47.773
This wasn't a game?

355
00:26:52.528 --> 00:26:53.278
Wh-What?

356
00:26:53.403 --> 00:26:54.530
We're leaving town right now!

357
00:26:54.655 --> 00:26:55.280
What?

358
00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:59.952
If we're going to clear this game any time soon,
we've got to get stronger.

359
00:27:00.494 --> 00:27:04.498
But it won't be long before the monsters
around here will be hunted clean by these players,

360
00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:06.875
and it's going to be tough to level up,
even just once.

361
00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:10.295
Wh-What you're saying
is going right over my head!

362
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.256
You don't have to understand right now.

363
00:27:12.381 --> 00:27:13.924
But we're getting out of here.

364
00:27:23.433 --> 00:27:24.560
Step back.

365
00:27:35.571 --> 00:27:36.405
Asuna!

366
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.952
No! No!

367
00:27:48.709 --> 00:27:49.585
Come on, let's go.

368
00:27:51.837 --> 00:27:52.462
Asuna?

369
00:27:52.588 --> 00:27:54.673
What is this?
I don't get it at all!

370
00:27:54.798 --> 00:27:55.924
We can't log out of this game?

371
00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:57.593
- How is that even possible?
- Hey, calm down.

372
00:27:57.718 --> 00:27:59.052
I have to take my entrance exams soon.

373
00:27:59.553 --> 00:28:01.513
Why is this happening?

374
00:28:01.972 --> 00:28:03.557
This is no time to be talking like that—

375
00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:06.727
I don't know anything about this game!

376
00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:07.936
Asuna.

377
00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:12.941
You can say that you want to move on
because you're good at these games!

378
00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:14.776
But it's different for me!

379
00:28:14.902 --> 00:28:16.862
So just leave me alone!

380
00:28:19.198 --> 00:28:20.991
<i>Hey, play with me!</i>

381
00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:23.243
<i>Let's defeat that boss today!</i>

382
00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:25.495
<i>What's wrong?</i>

383
00:28:25.662 --> 00:28:29.750
<i>That might be fun for you,
because you're good at those games, Misumi.</i>

384
00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:32.961
<i>- I mean, you're always the sole survivor!
- What?</i>

385
00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:36.381
<i>You can just leave us alone now.</i>

386
00:28:42.012 --> 00:28:44.890
Whatever you do,
don't say things like that.

387
00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:48.352
I know that you're scared.

388
00:28:48.477 --> 00:28:50.854
But just trust me.

389
00:28:51.313 --> 00:28:54.816
I'll teach you everything I know
about Sword Art Online.

390
00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:58.779
So let's try to clear the game together.

391
00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:01.490
And then let's go home together.

392
00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:04.952
Okay.

393
00:29:06.495 --> 00:29:09.498
You know how great a gamer I am, right?

394
00:29:10.165 --> 00:29:12.292
I'll protect you no matter what, all right?

395
00:29:18.715 --> 00:29:20.550
{\an8}ACCEPT REQUEST TO FORM A PARTY?

396
00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:20.550
What's this?

397
00:29:20.676 --> 00:29:24.930
It's something like proof
that we're friends over here.

398
00:29:25.806 --> 00:29:27.391
These games are so weird!

399
00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:30.018
We're already friends without doing that!

400
00:29:30.227 --> 00:29:32.604
This is one of the best parts of the game, okay?

401
00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:39.027
Now we're members of the same party.

402
00:29:40.362 --> 00:29:41.947
Once again,
I look forward to working with you.

403
00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:42.990
Right.

404
00:30:02.926 --> 00:30:03.969
No!

405
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.729
You're still pushing off too timidly.

406
00:30:15.188 --> 00:30:17.232
Let's see. Um...

407
00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:29.328
Wow!

408
00:30:29.453 --> 00:30:32.122
Instead of leaving it to the system's
Motion Assist feature,

409
00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:37.252
you can use your own athleticism to boost
the speed and force of your sword skills.

410
00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:38.628
Boost?

411
00:31:01.735 --> 00:31:02.861
I did it!

412
00:31:02.986 --> 00:31:05.572
That's it!
That's called an Outside System Skill.

413
00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:08.533
The sooner you master those, the better.

414
00:31:14.164 --> 00:31:17.501
This isn't right.
Not like this, but...

415
00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:22.756
Hey, why did we come out here,
so far from town?

416
00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:25.801
Wouldn't it be more convenient in town?

417
00:31:25.926 --> 00:31:31.181
Like I told you before,
MMORPGs are all about fighting over resources.

418
00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:35.811
We have to advance through this game with any
edge that we can or we're not going to survive.

419
00:31:36.144 --> 00:31:39.689
The area near Town of Beginnings
IS overrun with hunters,

420
00:31:39.815 --> 00:31:42.025
so it's getting harder to pop monsters.

421
00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:48.281
There are no more places near town where you
can battle while practicing your sword skills.

422
00:31:48.407 --> 00:31:52.285
This place is a well-kept secret, but it won't
be long before the players in town find it.

423
00:31:52.828 --> 00:31:56.039
Once we level up,
we need to head to the next town.

424
00:31:56.164 --> 00:31:57.833
You sure know everything, huh?

425
00:31:57.958 --> 00:32:00.210
Doing this kind of research—

426
00:32:00.335 --> 00:32:02.170
Is one of the best parts of the game, right?

427
00:32:07.426 --> 00:32:10.220
All right,
let's get a little more work in!

428
00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:11.221
Yeah!

429
00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:18.788
Switch!

430
00:33:32.135 --> 00:33:35.138
You're leveling up your sword skills
so fast, Asuna.

431
00:33:35.263 --> 00:33:37.098
Unlike how you sucked at fighting games!

432
00:33:37.224 --> 00:33:39.392
Hey, don't remind me!

433
00:33:39.518 --> 00:33:43.396
I guess I'm not half bad at battling
when I'm moving my own body.

434
00:33:43.522 --> 00:33:45.190
Let's move on.

435
00:33:45.315 --> 00:33:48.985
We've got to clear this dungeon today
and advance our quest.

436
00:33:52.113 --> 00:33:53.448
Empty again?

437
00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:56.535
All we're seeing is already-opened
treasure chests!

438
00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.329
This place might've been picked clean by now.

439
00:33:59.454 --> 00:34:01.414
What? There isn't even one left?

440
00:34:02.082 --> 00:34:04.167
It's first come, first served,
so there's nothing we can do.

441
00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:07.128
It must be the beta testers who have
the jump on us.

442
00:34:07.337 --> 00:34:08.547
Beta?

443
00:34:08.797 --> 00:34:14.344
Before the official SAO launch, there was a test
play period for about two months.

444
00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:16.846
That's what they call the players
who took part in it.

445
00:34:17.054 --> 00:34:20.100
Because if anyone knows where
the treasure chests are, it's them.

446
00:34:20.225 --> 00:34:21.851
Wow.

447
00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:25.063
Actually, I was a beta tester myself.

448
00:34:25.522 --> 00:34:28.858
Oh, so that's what you meant
when you said "prepping.”

449
00:34:28.984 --> 00:34:30.777
Hey, look over there!

450
00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:35.489
Hold up.

451
00:34:36.366 --> 00:34:38.368
Don't go opening it so carelessly.

452
00:34:38.493 --> 00:34:40.453
This dungeon is full of traps.

453
00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:42.621
Traps? You mean like booby traps?

454
00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:45.875
A poison arrow could come flying,
or there might be an explosion,

455
00:34:46.001 --> 00:34:48.628
or sometimes the treasure chest itself
turns out to be a monster.

456
00:34:49.004 --> 00:34:49.588
What?

457
00:34:49.713 --> 00:34:53.967
Since it's sitting here untouched,
odds are that it's a trap.

458
00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:57.387
If you have no locksmith skills,
it would be better to keep our hands off.

459
00:34:57.512 --> 00:34:59.097
O-Okay!

460
00:35:02.684 --> 00:35:03.810
I hear something.

461
00:35:13.737 --> 00:35:15.905
I wonder if someone's in battle?

462
00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:16.948
Probably.

463
00:35:43.183 --> 00:35:45.143
Why are there so many monsters?

464
00:35:45.518 --> 00:35:46.686
Over there.

465
00:35:48.355 --> 00:35:50.106
They fell into the trap.

466
00:35:50.565 --> 00:35:51.816
We've got to help them!

467
00:35:54.694 --> 00:35:57.030
There's nothing we can do at this point.

468
00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.281
But...

469
00:36:15.507 --> 00:36:18.677
If the monsters spot us,
they'll take us out, too.

470
00:36:18.927 --> 00:36:20.095
Let's head back.

471
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:49.833
I'm back!

472
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.001
Welcome home.

473
00:36:52.127 --> 00:36:53.461
I got all our shopping done!

474
00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:00.719
That didn't work out like I planned!

475
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:02.679
And what is this?

476
00:37:04.431 --> 00:37:05.640
Isn't it cute?

477
00:37:06.015 --> 00:37:07.517
Seriously.

478
00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:10.603
Hey, I did buy the potions, too.

479
00:37:10.812 --> 00:37:14.023
This equipment shop has a great selection!

480
00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:16.818
That doesn't make this any less overkill.

481
00:37:19.529 --> 00:37:21.531
Well, I got worried.

482
00:37:22.282 --> 00:37:24.492
You're feeling bad about that dungeon?

483
00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:30.331
What do you think happened
to those players?

484
00:37:32.292 --> 00:37:35.879
Did they really die in real life, too?

485
00:37:36.004 --> 00:37:38.548
That's what Akihiko Kayaba said.

486
00:37:38.673 --> 00:37:40.425
I can't believe it.

487
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:44.304
The way they just vanished was like
a video game.

488
00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:47.724
How could that lead
to them also dying in real life?

489
00:37:49.184 --> 00:37:51.811
Right... you're right.

490
00:37:52.729 --> 00:37:58.067
I thought that I knew this game well,
but maybe I never knew anything.

491
00:37:58.193 --> 00:38:00.695
But there's one thing I can say for sure.

492
00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:08.119
I won't let you die,
no matter what.

493
00:38:10.205 --> 00:38:14.334
That party we saw today... they weren't
cautious enough, or cool enough.

494
00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:16.711
If they'd kept their hands off
that sketchy treasure chest,

495
00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:18.963
they wouldn't have ended up like that.

496
00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:24.803
I'm not like them.
No way would I ever put you in danger.

497
00:38:28.348 --> 00:38:31.768
You're right. I'm safe as long
as I have you, right?

498
00:38:31.976 --> 00:38:33.853
Right. I promise you.

499
00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:36.648
Okay, let's get our items organized.

500
00:38:36.773 --> 00:38:39.150
Since we'll be heading
to the next town tomorrow.

501
00:38:39.275 --> 00:38:41.569
Okay. Hey, hold up a second!

502
00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:48.493
Hey, I can easily customize my hairstyle
from the menu—

503
00:38:48.618 --> 00:38:50.829
But that wouldn't be any fun!

504
00:38:54.249 --> 00:38:56.167
This feels kind of weird.

505
00:38:56.584 --> 00:38:57.752
Don't move, okay?

506
00:38:57.877 --> 00:38:59.629
Fine, fine.

507
00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:06.761
Since we're doing this,
let's do your hair just like mine.

508
00:39:06.886 --> 00:39:08.847
It's my way of thanking you
for that time you did it for me.

509
00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:12.100
What? But it only looks good on you, Asuna.

510
00:39:12.225 --> 00:39:14.143
Those cute hairstyles aren't for me—

511
00:39:14.269 --> 00:39:16.020
Just sit tight, okay?

512
00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:30.702
Are you okay?

513
00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:32.745
Yeah. Thanks!

514
00:39:32.996 --> 00:39:35.290
Watch out for monsters, too, okay?

515
00:39:35.415 --> 00:39:38.459
Because high-level Little Nepenthes have
been known to show up around here.

516
00:39:38.585 --> 00:39:40.128
Nepenthes?

517
00:39:40.253 --> 00:39:43.381
But I thought that Nepenthes
were pitcher plants.

518
00:39:43.506 --> 00:39:46.175
That's right.
They're carnivorous plant monsters.

519
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:49.679
Now that we've leveled up,
they're not really a threat to us,

520
00:39:49.804 --> 00:39:52.181
but we've got to be careful
because the terrain is unstable.

521
00:39:52.432 --> 00:39:53.308
All right!

522
00:39:53.433 --> 00:39:56.185
Also, once in a while you'll see a Nepenthe
with a round fruit on its head,

523
00:39:56.311 --> 00:39:59.022
but whatever you do,
don't attack it.

524
00:39:59.147 --> 00:39:59.814
Why not?

525
00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:03.693
Because if it's damaged,
it emits smoke to summon its comrades.

526
00:40:03.818 --> 00:40:06.779
Then a whole horde shows up,
and you can't escape them.

527
00:40:07.155 --> 00:40:08.406
I'll be careful.

528
00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:12.452
Hey... are those the Nepenthes you
were talking about?

529
00:40:14.954 --> 00:40:18.708
Remember, if the one with the fruit shows up,
don't attack it, no matter what.

530
00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:19.751
Okay!

531
00:40:29.844 --> 00:40:31.512
You got this, Asuna!

532
00:40:31.638 --> 00:40:34.641
If we keep this up, it won't be long
before we can wipe them out!

533
00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:40.521
Is that a Spry Shrewman?

534
00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:43.483
There's one heading your way!

535
00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:54.118
Asuna! Can you handle this for a second?

536
00:40:54.869 --> 00:40:55.620
What's going on?

537
00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:58.790
I just saw a monster that almost never
shows up on the first floor.

538
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.292
It drops rare items, so I want
to vanquish it when I have the chance.

539
00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:03.628
Fine! Just leave this to me!

540
00:41:34.742 --> 00:41:36.077
All right!

541
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.422
I snagged the item!

542
00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.549
Good for you!

543
00:41:56.431 --> 00:41:57.890
Asuna! No!

544
00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:25.960
Asuna!

545
00:42:38.514 --> 00:42:39.348
Asuna!

546
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:40.475
Mito!

547
00:43:14.342 --> 00:43:15.760
Asuna.

548
00:43:28.022 --> 00:43:29.857
I can get to the top from here.

549
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:44.956
That's my last one!

550
00:44:03.182 --> 00:44:04.642
I don't want to die!

551
00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:07.103
Mito! Hurry up and come!

552
00:44:37.383 --> 00:44:39.135
Just one more.

553
00:45:01.949 --> 00:45:03.284
No way.

554
00:45:17.924 --> 00:45:19.050
I don't want to see this!

555
00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:25.014
<i>No way would I ever put you in danger.</i>

556
00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:29.518
Sorry, Asuna.

557
00:45:29.644 --> 00:45:30.978
I can't keep...

558
00:45:33.189 --> 00:45:34.815
...my promise to you.

559
00:45:39.237 --> 00:45:40.613
{\an8}MITO HAS LEFT THE PARTY

560
00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:41.572
What?

561
00:45:42.657 --> 00:45:43.532
Mito?

562
00:45:43.658 --> 00:45:44.492
What?

563
00:45:45.034 --> 00:45:46.244
What's going on?

564
00:45:49.163 --> 00:45:52.166
I'm sorry... I'm sorry!

565
00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:27.928
Are you all right?
How much HP do you have left?

566
00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:34.477
I'll take you back to town.

567
00:47:47.365 --> 00:47:49.241
Would this be enough?

568
00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:54.497
There's also map data to the nearest town,
so you should be able to get back on your own.

569
00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:13.474
All right, I'm taking off now.

570
00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:24.693
Asuna.

571
00:48:42.378 --> 00:48:44.797
Sorry, Asuna.

572
00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:15.077
{\an8}ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO LOG OUT?

573
00:49:41.937 --> 00:49:44.148
Asuna? We've been looking for you.

574
00:49:44.273 --> 00:49:45.649
Mother?

575
00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:49.111
Come downstairs.
Let's all have dinner together.

576
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:56.285
See? These are all your favorites, aren't they?

577
00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:59.288
Asuna, I hear that you aced your tests.

578
00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:03.209
Your mother tells me that you even had
some perfect scores!

579
00:50:03.542 --> 00:50:08.589
That's right! Asuna, I'm impressed by all
your hard work.

580
00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:10.049
Mother!

581
00:50:10.424 --> 00:50:13.886
I know, we'll have to get her
a gift for getting into high school!

582
00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:16.138
Don't you think you're getting ahead
of yourself there?

583
00:50:16.263 --> 00:50:19.433
Hey, why not?
How about going on a family trip?

584
00:50:19.558 --> 00:50:21.560
You're saying that because you want
to go, right?

585
00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:25.314
Let's take a break from work and spend
some quality time with each other for once!

586
00:50:25.439 --> 00:50:25.981
I need to take tons of pictures
of my beloved sister while I have the chance!

587
00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:27.900
NEW MESSAGE
MITO HAS LEFT THE PARTY
I need to take tons of pictures
of my beloved sister while I have the chance!

588
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.652
I need to take tons of pictures
of my beloved sister while I have the chance!

589
00:50:39.954 --> 00:50:40.788
Mito?

590
00:50:42.122 --> 00:50:43.958
Goodbye, Asuna.

591
00:50:48.045 --> 00:50:49.213
Mito!

592
00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:52.091
Mito!

593
00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:04.562
I'm still inside the game.

594
00:51:08.607 --> 00:51:13.821
I hear that some players finally made it
to the dungeon on Floor 1.

595
00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:17.825
It's been three weeks now. That's it?

596
00:51:18.325 --> 00:51:19.994
How many years is it going
to take to clear this game?

597
00:51:20.119 --> 00:51:23.789
Clear? What are you smoking?
Never gonna happen!

598
00:51:23.998 --> 00:51:26.625
1,800 people have died already!

599
00:51:28.377 --> 00:51:31.714
No matter what we do,
we're all gonna die!

600
00:51:44.101 --> 00:51:45.853
<i>I have one last warning for you.</i>

601
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:49.815
<i>This may be a game,
but it's not something you play.</i>

602
00:51:51.108 --> 00:51:53.777
<i>This is my reality.</i>

603
00:51:59.283 --> 00:52:01.660
<i>I can't choose how I'm going to live anymore.</i>

604
00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:05.873
But I can at least choose how
I'm going to die.

605
00:52:06.624 --> 00:52:08.751
So that I can still be me.

606
00:52:14.173 --> 00:52:15.049
{\an8}SELL THE SELECTED ITEMS?

607
00:52:15.174 --> 00:52:16.175
{\an8}ALL ITEMS HAVE BEEN SOLD

608
00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:27.144
<i>Even if I'm killed by a monster,</i>

609
00:52:27.269 --> 00:52:31.190
<i>I don't want to lose to this game...
to this world.</i>

610
00:53:29.456 --> 00:53:31.542
That was way too overkill.

611
00:53:31.959 --> 00:53:36.004
That kobold was already on the brink
of death after that first Linear.

612
00:53:36.839 --> 00:53:38.257
<i>He's the one from that day?</i>

613
00:53:38.465 --> 00:53:43.262
You could've finished it off with an easy
normal skill instead of a sword skill.

614
00:53:43.637 --> 00:53:45.472
<i>He doesn't recognize me.</i>

615
00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:47.725
Something wrong with being excessive?

616
00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:52.855
Don't forget there's the return trip, too.
You should fight in a way that's not too taxing.

617
00:53:53.272 --> 00:53:54.648
Return trip?

618
00:53:54.773 --> 00:53:58.527
Yeah, it's going to take about an hour just
to get out of this dungeon,

619
00:53:58.652 --> 00:54:02.239
and even if you rush,
the nearest town is a half hour away.

620
00:54:02.364 --> 00:54:04.199
You'll make more mistakes
if you're exhausted.

621
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:07.035
From what I can tell,
you're a solo player,

622
00:54:07.161 --> 00:54:10.664
and if you're on your own,
even the smallest mistake could be fatal.

623
00:54:11.874 --> 00:54:13.584
Well, that's not going to be a problem.

624
00:54:13.751 --> 00:54:15.544
Since I'm not going back.

625
00:54:15.669 --> 00:54:18.422
Huh? Not going back—
to the town, you mean?

626
00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:22.509
But you need to replenish your potions,
and get your weapons serviced.

627
00:54:22.634 --> 00:54:24.136
- And sleep—
- I won't need potions

628
00:54:24.261 --> 00:54:25.929
if I don't sustain any damage,

629
00:54:26.054 --> 00:54:28.432
and I've brought five
of the same type of sword.

630
00:54:28.557 --> 00:54:31.310
And I'm resting in the nearby safe zone.

631
00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:34.146
How many hours have you been at this?

632
00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:36.190
Three days. Maybe four.

633
00:54:36.315 --> 00:54:37.691
We're done here.

634
00:54:37.816 --> 00:54:40.778
If you keep fighting like that, you'll die.

635
00:54:41.195 --> 00:54:43.447
We're all going to die anyway.

636
00:54:43.822 --> 00:54:46.700
Nearly 2,000 players have died
in just a month.

637
00:54:46.825 --> 00:54:50.412
But no one's cleared even the first floor.

638
00:54:50.537 --> 00:54:52.831
This game just can't be completed.

639
00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:54.458
It's only a matter of where
and how you'll die...

640
00:54:55.334 --> 00:54:56.919
And how soon or how late.

641
00:55:11.225 --> 00:55:12.851
Why am I...

642
00:55:21.235 --> 00:55:23.278
You really overstepped.

643
00:55:23.487 --> 00:55:25.697
It's not like I saved you.

644
00:55:26.615 --> 00:55:28.450
Then why didn't you leave me behind?

645
00:55:28.575 --> 00:55:32.371
What I wanted to save
was the map data you have.

646
00:55:32.496 --> 00:55:35.249
If you've been cooped up near
the front lines for four days,

647
00:55:35.374 --> 00:55:37.709
you must've mapped a lot
of the untrodden areas.

648
00:55:38.502 --> 00:55:41.672
I just thought it would be a waste
for it to vanish along with you.

649
00:55:44.383 --> 00:55:45.884
Then why don't you take it?

650
00:55:48.303 --> 00:55:49.763
{\an8}OUTPUT MAP DATA?

651
00:55:52.724 --> 00:55:54.601
All right, I'll be on my way now.

652
00:55:55.227 --> 00:55:57.312
Hold up, Ms. Fencer.

653
00:55:57.604 --> 00:56:02.150
Basically, you're grinding away
to clear this game, right?

654
00:56:02.276 --> 00:56:04.361
Not to end up dead in a dungeon?

655
00:56:04.486 --> 00:56:07.656
If that's the case, don't you think you
should show up at the meeting, too?

656
00:56:08.657 --> 00:56:09.533
Meeting?

657
00:56:09.658 --> 00:56:15.914
{\an8}FLOOR 1
TOLBANA

658
00:56:09.658 --> 00:56:15.914
There's going to be a Floor 1 Boss Raid
meeting in Tolbana today.

659
00:56:21.295 --> 00:56:23.380
This many players?

660
00:56:24.006 --> 00:56:26.425
Even though they could die?

661
00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:27.843
I don't know about that.

662
00:56:28.093 --> 00:56:29.219
What?

663
00:56:30.304 --> 00:56:32.472
I wouldn't say it's everyone,

664
00:56:32.598 --> 00:56:35.559
but it's less about the manifestation
of self-sacrifice,

665
00:56:35.684 --> 00:56:39.646
and more about the fear of falling behind
that brought most people here.

666
00:56:39.938 --> 00:56:43.066
I'm probably the latter myself.

667
00:56:43.275 --> 00:56:44.401
Falling behind?

668
00:56:44.526 --> 00:56:45.360
Behind what?

669
00:56:45.694 --> 00:56:49.197
The front lines, see.
Sure, the thought of dying scares me,

670
00:56:49.323 --> 00:56:53.577
but it's just as scary to know that the boss
might be defeated without my knowing.

671
00:56:54.995 --> 00:56:58.248
Is that like not wanting to drop out
of the top ten in your grade,

672
00:56:58.373 --> 00:57:00.500
or wanting to maintain
your 70th percentile rank...

673
00:57:00.626 --> 00:57:02.836
Is it the same kind of motivation?

674
00:57:03.754 --> 00:57:07.591
Uh... well, it probably is.

675
00:57:11.678 --> 00:57:16.266
Okay, let's get started, people!

676
00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.937
Thank you for responding
to my summons today.

677
00:57:20.062 --> 00:57:24.274
My name is Diabel. My job is...
in my own mind, I like to think I'm a "Knight."

678
00:57:25.233 --> 00:57:28.445
There's no job system in this game!

679
00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:35.953
Today, our party discovered the boss room
at the top of that tower.

680
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.875
We need to defeat the boss,
reach the second floor,

681
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.045
and tell everyone waiting
in Town of Beginnings

682
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:48.840
that it's possible to one day beat
this death game.

683
00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:52.970
And that's the duty of every one
of us here now!

684
00:57:53.095 --> 00:57:54.221
Isn't that right, everybody?

685
00:58:02.896 --> 00:58:07.526
Okay! Then without further delay,
I'd like to get this boss raid meeting started.

686
00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:10.153
First, I want you to team up
into parties of six.

687
00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:14.992
A conventional party has no chance against
a floor boss.

688
00:58:15.242 --> 00:58:18.161
We'll need to form a raid group
using multiple parties.

689
00:58:21.999 --> 00:58:23.917
You got left out, too?

690
00:58:27.254 --> 00:58:30.382
Everyone else seemed to be friends already,
so I just stayed out of it.

691
00:58:31.299 --> 00:58:33.552
Hey, want to form a party with me?

692
00:58:34.428 --> 00:58:37.431
He just said we can't beat
the boss on our own, right?

693
00:58:37.556 --> 00:58:39.016
It's just for this fight... temporarily.

694
00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:47.983
{\an8}ACCEPT REQUEST TO FORM A PARTY?

695
00:58:53.447 --> 00:58:55.198
{\an8}ACCEPT REQUEST TO FORM A PARTY?

696
00:58:55.949 --> 00:58:58.660
Okay, are you about done forming
your parties?

697
00:58:58.785 --> 00:59:01.079
- Then—
- Hold up a second!

698
00:59:03.498 --> 00:59:05.709
My name's Kibaou.

699
00:59:06.209 --> 00:59:09.671
There's something I want
to say before we take on the boss.

700
00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:15.969
Some of you here need to apologize
to the 2,000 who have died so far!

701
00:59:18.597 --> 00:59:21.975
Kibaou, these people you're referring to...

702
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.853
Do you mean the ex-beta testers, perhaps?

703
00:59:24.978 --> 00:59:26.229
Darn right I do!

704
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.816
On the day that this stupid game started,
the beta guys ditched us beginners,

705
00:59:29.941 --> 00:59:31.693
and they all disappeared.

706
00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:35.489
They took all the good hunting spots
and easy quests for themselves,

707
00:59:35.614 --> 00:59:39.743
so they were the only ones getting stronger.
And since then, they've just ignored the rest of us.

708
00:59:39.868 --> 00:59:42.746
There's got to be some of them here!
Guys who were beta testers!

709
00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:44.998
We should make them get on their knees
and apologize,

710
00:59:45.123 --> 00:59:47.375
and give up all the items
and money they've hoarded!

711
00:59:47.959 --> 00:59:50.504
As party members,
we can't put our lives in their hands,

712
00:59:50.629 --> 00:59:52.172
and they can't put their lives in ours!

713
00:59:52.506 --> 00:59:53.840
Can I say something?

714
00:59:59.346 --> 01:00:01.014
My name is Agil.

715
01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:04.267
Kibaou, let me get this straight.

716
01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:06.853
You're saying that because
the ex-beta testers didn't take care of them,

717
01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:10.565
many beginners died.
That they should take responsibility,

718
01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:12.651
apologize, and provide compensation.
Is that right?

719
01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:14.194
Y-Yeah.

720
01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:17.697
You received this guide book, too, didn't you?

721
01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:20.158
It was provided for free
at the item store, after all.

722
01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:22.285
Sure, I got it.
So what if I did?

723
01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:26.123
It was the ex-beta testers
who were distributing these.

724
01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:29.584
Listen up. Everyone had equal access
to this information.

725
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.546
And yet many players still died.

726
01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:34.047
What can we learn from those failures,

727
01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.383
and how should we go about trying
to defeat the boss?

728
01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:40.053
At least, that's what I thought
we'd be discussing here.

729
01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:46.768
Okay, can we resume the meeting now?

730
01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:48.311
As for information on the boss,

731
01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:52.232
actually, the latest edition
of that guide book was just issued.

732
01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:56.570
According to what it says,
the boss's name is Illfang the Kobold Lord.

733
01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:59.197
Also, he has an entourage known
as the Ruin Kobold Sentinels

734
01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.700
that appear as a group of three at most.

735
01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:04.035
The boss is armed with an axe and a buckler.

736
01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:07.330
He has four health bars,
and when the last one turns red,

737
01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:10.208
he switches to a curved sword-type weapon
called a Talwar.

738
01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.918
His attack pattern changes as well.

739
01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:14.045
Whoa. Where did they get that info?

740
01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:15.839
This concludes the briefing.

741
01:01:15.964 --> 01:01:18.383
Lastly, regarding item distribution,

742
01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:20.719
money will be automatically
divided equally.

743
01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:23.305
EXP goes to the party that defeats the monster.

744
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:26.016
And whoever receives an item keeps it.

745
01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:27.642
Any objections?

746
01:01:28.727 --> 01:01:31.730
Okay, we leave tomorrow,
at 10:00 in the morning.

747
01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:33.690
All right, dismissed!

748
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:48.747
Mito?

749
01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:11.853
Those are pretty tasty, aren't they?

750
01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:15.357
Mind if I sit down?

751
01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.872
Do you really think it's good?

752
01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:33.875
Of course.

753
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.878
Ever since I came to this town,
I've been eating at least one daily.

754
01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:39.172
Well, but I do change it up a little, though.

755
01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:40.131
Change it up?

756
01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:42.050
Try putting some on that bread.

757
01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:51.643
Cream?

758
01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:24.342
Thank you for the cream.

759
01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.136
You're welcome.

760
01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:30.807
It's the reward for a quest called "The Heifer
Strikes Back" one village behind us.

761
01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:33.184
If you want to do it,
I'll tell you what the trick is.

762
01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:39.441
I didn't come to this town
to eat good food.

763
01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.444
Then, why did you?

764
01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:46.698
Rather than lock myself inside an inn
and slowly rot away,

765
01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:49.826
I'd rather stay myself until
the very last moment.

766
01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:52.203
Even if I'm defeated by a monster,

767
01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:55.707
I don't want to lose to this game...
to this world.

768
01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:58.168
No matter what.

769
01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:07.010
I wouldn't want a party member dying on me.

770
01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:08.636
So at the very least,
don't die tomorrow.

771
01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:13.683
That's why I want to discuss how we're going
to fight in the boss raid today.

772
01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:15.769
Do you have a minute?

773
01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.146
Where would we discuss that?

774
01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:21.024
Some nearby bar, or inn, maybe?

775
01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:24.152
I don't want to be seen
and have people get the wrong idea!

776
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.821
There are other rooms for rent.

777
01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:30.408
For example, the place I'm renting
is the second floor of an NPC farmhouse.

778
01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.118
It's got two rooms
and all the milk you can drink.

779
01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.496
The bed's huge,
and the view is awesome,

780
01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:36.664
and to top it off,
it's got a bath—

781
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.334
What did you say?

782
01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:41.169
A-All the milk you can drink?

783
01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:42.128
The one after that.

784
01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:44.381
Th-The bed's huge,
and the view is awesome?

785
01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:45.382
After that!

786
01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:48.802
I-It's got a bath?

787
01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.180
Take me to your place...

788
01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.766
...and let me use... your bath?

789
01:04:55.517 --> 01:04:57.769
Uh, sure.

790
01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:09.531
Unbelievable!

791
01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:12.700
To think that such wonderful bathtubs
exist in this world!

792
01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:16.037
Yeah. Um, have a good one!

793
01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.125
No lock?

794
01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.836
Nothing I can do, I guess.

795
01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:27.966
{\an8}REMOVE EQUIPMENT?

796
01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:37.350
{\an8}REMOVE UNDERGARMENTS?

797
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:09.841
I can die anytime now!

798
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.552
I have absolutely no regrets!

799
01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:18.266
Oh, but that cream-topped rye bun...

800
01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:21.394
What wouldn't I give
to have it again before I die?

801
01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:28.359
Y-You done?

802
01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.153
What are you doing in the corner there?

803
01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:32.530
Oh, uh...

804
01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:34.782
What?

805
01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:36.743
Uh, nothing.

806
01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:43.041
Before our meeting,
let's take this and head out.

807
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:47.420
This rapier was a drop item,
but I'm not going to use it, so—

808
01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:48.505
What are we—

809
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:52.133
We can still make it to one of the forges
before it closes.

810
01:06:58.139 --> 01:07:00.308
I was able to level it up to plus four.

811
01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:03.186
It should be way better than the rapier
you've been using.

812
01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:04.479
Why would you do that?

813
01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:06.564
We're going on a raid tomorrow.

814
01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.317
We've got to do whatever we can do.

815
01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:11.152
That doesn't mean you should have
to get me a weapon—

816
01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:15.114
It's just that I don't want my party member
dying on me.

817
01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:18.701
What I really want is to search
for rare equipment,

818
01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:20.703
but since there's no time for that—

819
01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.831
Let's talk about the boss raid
when we get back.

820
01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:25.792
Just keep me company a little while longer.

821
01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:27.126
Listen.

822
01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:29.837
At today's meeting...

823
01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:32.799
You know how they were talking about
the beta testers?

824
01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:34.467
Uh, yeah.

825
01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:35.760
What kind of people are they?

826
01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:36.970
What kind?

827
01:07:37.095 --> 01:07:41.099
Kibaou was criticizing
the beta testers.

828
01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:44.936
He said they were selfish
and they'd abandoned us other players.

829
01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:49.983
But Agil said that some of them
were also passing on information to us.

830
01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:54.028
Do these games just change
who people are?

831
01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.699
Did you have some kind of run-in
with a beta tester?

832
01:07:58.366 --> 01:08:00.243
You can tell me about it if you want.

833
01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:03.705
Since I'm a solo player,
there's no risk that it'll get leaked.

834
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.669
We were friends in the real world,

835
01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:11.629
and after we came here, too.

836
01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:15.133
I see. So a member of your party.

837
01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:19.761
She was getting hold of a monster's
rare item at the time.

838
01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:22.348
Meaning it was more important
to her than me.

839
01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:27.562
After all the time we'd spent together, why?

840
01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:31.441
What kind of monster was it?

841
01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:33.901
What do you mean?

842
01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:35.903
Like, was it an insect type or animal type?

843
01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:37.904
Tell me anything you can about
what it looked like.

844
01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:41.618
Uh, it was like a small mouse-human.

845
01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:45.037
What was her main weapon?

846
01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:46.788
A rapier, like yours?

847
01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:49.334
No, she fought with a scythe.

848
01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:52.295
I see.

849
01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:56.716
SAO is no ordinary game.

850
01:08:57.425 --> 01:08:59.176
Our lives are at stake.

851
01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:01.679
On top of that,
in the heat of battle,

852
01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:04.974
in extreme life-or-death situations,

853
01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:08.185
a person would do anything to survive.

854
01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:14.901
But in a situation like this,
there's no telling what people are capable of.

855
01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:19.863
You can see who a person really is
when she's being nonchalant and normal.

856
01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.741
That's what I think.

857
01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:24.911
It doesn't matter if you're
a beta tester or not.

858
01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:27.913
What kind of person she is...

859
01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:31.834
You should know that yourself.

860
01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:34.962
I know... who she is?

861
01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:37.090
<i>I'm going to clue you in
to the best part of this game.</i>

862
01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:39.341
<i>Whatever you do,
don't say things like that.</i>

863
01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:42.095
<i>That's it!
This feels kind of weird.</i>

864
01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.346
<i>It's my masterpiece.</i>

865
01:09:44.471 --> 01:09:45.223
<i>I'll send it to you.</i>

866
01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:49.394
<i>Just as I thought.
You look great!</i>

867
01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.354
<i>Mito...</i>

868
01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:57.735
Thank you. I feel a little calmer now.

869
01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.404
You do?

870
01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:04.117
That girl is something else.
She said, "Let's clear this game together," right?

871
01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:06.744
Instead of abandoning you, a beginner?

872
01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.247
That's something that I never could've done.

873
01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:12.208
Sorry.

874
01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:15.378
The reason you're in this situation
in the first place...

875
01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:18.756
In other words, what drove you
into the corner,

876
01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.633
in a sense, it's my...

877
01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:25.096
What you just started to say...

878
01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:30.059
If we both survive the boss raid,
let me hear the rest.

879
01:10:40.945 --> 01:10:42.155
I'm going to double-check, okay?

880
01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:48.202
As the leftover team, our target is the Ruin
Kobold Sentinels—the boss's entourage.

881
01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:49.120
I know.

882
01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:53.291
I'll use a sword skill
to knock their pole axes up.

883
01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:55.877
The second I do,
switch and jump in.

884
01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:03.259
Tell me, before you came here,
you played, um...

885
01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.429
...these MMO games, right?

886
01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:08.890
Uh, well, yeah.

887
01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:11.642
Was traveling the same as this in other games?

888
01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:14.312
You know, like a field trip?

889
01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:16.481
Field trip... I like that.

890
01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:20.693
Sorry to say that with other titles,
it was a far cry from this.

891
01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:25.448
I mean, with non-full-dive games,
you have to use the keyboard or mouse,

892
01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:27.825
or operate a controller.

893
01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:29.786
Oh, I see.

894
01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:32.955
Then what's the real thing like?

895
01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.415
The real thing?

896
01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:38.336
You know, assuming a fantasy world
like this really existed,

897
01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:42.173
and that a band of swordsmen
or magicians on an adventure there...

898
01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:45.343
...set off to take down
a terrifying monster boss.

899
01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:48.221
What would they talk about
on their way there?

900
01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:50.973
Or would they just walk on in silence?

901
01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:52.266
That's what I mean.

902
01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:58.981
The road to either death or glory, huh?

903
01:11:59.106 --> 01:12:02.109
If we're talking about people who live that
as their normal life,

904
01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:06.364
then it's probably like going to a restaurant
to have dinner.

905
01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:10.117
They'll talk if they have something to say,
and be silent if they don't.

906
01:12:10.243 --> 01:12:14.080
I bet these boss raids will end up
like that someday, too.

907
01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:17.542
That is, if we can make challenging bosses
a normal part of our lives.

908
01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:25.132
Sorry for laughing.
But what you just said is absurd!

909
01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:27.885
This world couldn't be farther
from normal life.

910
01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.346
And you're saying we can make it normal?

911
01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:32.932
You do have a point there.

912
01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:36.352
But listen, it's already been four weeks today.

913
01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:39.272
Even if we manage to take down
the Floor 1 boss today,

914
01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:42.650
there'll still be 99 floors above us.

915
01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:44.110
If we keep repeating
the process over and over,

916
01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:46.654
then the abnormal will become normal, too.

917
01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:50.908
You're strong, I see.
I could never do that.

918
01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:53.536
Live in this world for years on end.

919
01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:56.747
Because that thought scares me
way more than dying today.

920
01:12:56.873 --> 01:13:01.669
Hmm... if we can make it to the upper levels,
we'll find even nicer bathtubs, you know.

921
01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:03.045
R-Really?

922
01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:06.674
That's right! So we've got
to go home alive today, okay?

923
01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.817
Listen up, everyone.

924
01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:27.820
I have only one thing to say.

925
01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:35.912
Let's win!

926
01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:43.711
Let's go!

927
01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:37.848
Commence attack!

928
01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.617
Squad A! Squad C!
Switch! Here it comes!

929
01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:58.077
Squad B, block!

930
01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:01.414
Squad C, keep guarding
and prepare to switch.

931
01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:10.548
Now! As you fall back,
prepare to attack from the side!

932
01:15:10.798 --> 01:15:13.509
Squads D, E, and F,
keep the sentinels off us!

933
01:15:13.634 --> 01:15:14.552
Roger!

934
01:15:27.314 --> 01:15:28.149
Switch!

935
01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:40.578
Next!

936
01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.038
More are coming!

937
01:15:44.915 --> 01:15:45.875
Switch!

938
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:46.876
Switch!

939
01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:48.127
Switch!

940
01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:49.211
There's a fifth one!

941
01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:56.552
<i>This boy... he's so powerful.</i>

942
01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:58.596
Good job!

943
01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:01.057
You, too.

944
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.231
Looking good! We're almost there!

945
01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.867
Looks like that information was right.

946
01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:21.827
Squad C! Surround the boss!

947
01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.829
I'm going after the target!

948
01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:39.845
That weapon!

949
01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:41.806
It's not the same as the beta test!

950
01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:44.141
It's no good! Stay back!

951
01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:46.268
You'll be hit with a range attack!

952
01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:07.748
C-Can't move...

953
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:33.732
Diabel!

954
01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:37.570
Hang in there!

955
01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.459
Please... defeat...

956
01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:54.044
Defeat the boss.

957
01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:57.339
For everyone...

958
01:18:20.571 --> 01:18:22.740
Why? No way.

959
01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:23.991
There should've only been three of them!

960
01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:25.951
This isn't what we signed up for!

961
01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.215
- Look out!
- Hold up!

962
01:18:40.674 --> 01:18:42.551
Going on your own won't help!

963
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.012
You'll end up getting killed, too!

964
01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.601
{\an8}MITO HAS LEFT THE PARTY

965
01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:04.406
H-Hey, thanks. I owe you—

966
01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:08.786
<i>That skill...</i>

967
01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:09.828
Switch!

968
01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:26.428
We're getting in on the action, too!

969
01:19:26.553 --> 01:19:27.805
Come on, over here!

970
01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:33.727
Wait!

971
01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:37.690
Asuna...

972
01:19:37.982 --> 01:19:39.483
Asuna, is that you?

973
01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.319
No way.

974
01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:46.240
You're alive?

975
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.201
I...

976
01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:53.622
I...

977
01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:57.334
That day...

978
01:20:08.429 --> 01:20:10.639
We are going to clear this game, aren't we?

979
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.561
The boss isn't done yet.

980
01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:17.646
Let's both survive this.

981
01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:23.986
I've seen that range attack by
the boss before, during the beta test.

982
01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:27.239
But you have to surround the enemy
for it to be launched.

983
01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:30.993
Asuna!

984
01:20:31.618 --> 01:20:32.745
Use this!

985
01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:38.584
<i>It drops rare items, so I want
to vanquish it when I have the chance.</i>

986
01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.044
<i>This is from that day.</i>

987
01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:51.138
Thanks!

988
01:21:05.986 --> 01:21:06.779
Switch!

989
01:21:11.075 --> 01:21:11.950
Not yet!

990
01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.760
Huh? Y-You're...

991
01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.721
Everyone, listen to me!

992
01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:36.350
We have to surround the boss,
or there won't be a range attack!

993
01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:38.227
For now, everyone fall back!

994
01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.896
Everyone who's recovered,
get back into battle!

995
01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:51.615
Let's take it down together.

996
01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:53.700
Right!

997
01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:35.742
Almost there.

998
01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:40.372
Oh, crap—

999
01:23:10.611 --> 01:23:11.695
Mito!

1000
01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:36.595
Asuna!

1001
01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:39.973
One last Linear!
Let's do it together!

1002
01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:41.058
Roger!

1003
01:23:58.909 --> 01:24:00.202
One more time!

1004
01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:11.838
Mito!

1005
01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:22.182
- Switch!
- Switch!

1006
01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:56.967
We did it!

1007
01:25:08.478 --> 01:25:09.354
Good work.

1008
01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:12.816
Let me chime in.

1009
01:25:13.275 --> 01:25:15.027
You put up a splendid fight.

1010
01:25:15.152 --> 01:25:18.655
Congratulations!
That was a sight to see!

1011
01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:25.162
- Asuna!
- Why?

1012
01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:34.504
Why... why did you let Diabel die?

1013
01:25:35.255 --> 01:25:36.173
Let him die?

1014
01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:37.424
Of course you did!

1015
01:25:37.883 --> 01:25:41.386
You knew what technique
the boss would use!

1016
01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:46.642
If you'd given us that information up front,
Diabel wouldn't have had to die!

1017
01:25:49.186 --> 01:25:51.146
Come to think of it, he's right.

1018
01:25:51.271 --> 01:25:51.938
Yeah.

1019
01:25:52.439 --> 01:25:53.815
How does he know?

1020
01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:55.776
It wasn't even in the guide book.

1021
01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:57.194
Don't tell me it was all lies?

1022
01:25:57.319 --> 01:26:00.280
But it did say that the boss info
was from the beta test, right?

1023
01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:01.490
- All of you—
- Hey! You guys!

1024
01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:04.826
That's right!
He must be an ex-beta tester!

1025
01:26:04.951 --> 01:26:07.746
That's how he knew all about
the boss's attack patterns.

1026
01:26:07.871 --> 01:26:09.414
That woman must be one, too!

1027
01:26:09.539 --> 01:26:12.709
So they knew all the good quests
and hunting grounds,

1028
01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:15.170
but they've been keeping them from us
and duping us!

1029
01:26:17.547 --> 01:26:21.718
That guide book, too—that information broker,
Argo, just sold us a pack of lies!

1030
01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:26.473
She's an ex-beta tester, too,
so no way would she tell us the truth for free!

1031
01:26:26.598 --> 01:26:30.435
There's gotta be others here, too, right?
Those beta testers? Show yourselves!

1032
01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:38.318
... I...

1033
01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:47.744
An ex-beta tester, did you say?

1034
01:26:48.995 --> 01:26:53.875
I wish you wouldn't lump me together
with those newbies.

1035
01:26:54.126 --> 01:26:55.585
Don't get the wrong idea.

1036
01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:59.047
That girl there was only following my orders.

1037
01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:00.632
She's nothing but an amateur.

1038
01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:06.513
Most of the thousand people who won
SAO beta test slots...

1039
01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:09.599
...were newbies who didn't even
know how to level up.

1040
01:27:10.267 --> 01:27:12.519
Even you guys are better than them.

1041
01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:14.020
Wh-What did you say?

1042
01:27:14.855 --> 01:27:17.482
But I'm not like those guys.

1043
01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:23.238
During the beta test, I made it to higher levels
than anyone else was able to reach.

1044
01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:25.532
The reason I knew about
the boss's sword skills...

1045
01:27:25.657 --> 01:27:29.995
...was because I'd fought tons of monsters
with those skills on floors far above us.

1046
01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:32.622
I know lots of other things, too.

1047
01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:35.459
Your information brokers
have nothing on me!

1048
01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:38.879
W-What's that about?

1049
01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:41.882
You're—You're way worse than
a beta tester!

1050
01:27:42.299 --> 01:27:44.634
That's cheating!
You're a cheater, that's what you are!

1051
01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:46.178
Right, he's a cheater!

1052
01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:48.555
A beta tester and a cheater...
A beater!

1053
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.390
Damned beater! Duping us like that!

1054
01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:52.434
Are the other beta testers doing
the same thing?

1055
01:27:52.559 --> 01:27:55.479
Dirty beater—keeping all
the information for himself!

1056
01:27:56.438 --> 01:27:59.441
A beater... that's a good name.

1057
01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.944
That's right. I'm a beater.

1058
01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:06.698
From now on, don't confuse me
with those lame ex-testers.

1059
01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:13.455
I'm going to activate
the Teleport Gate to Floor 2 for you.

1060
01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.582
To get to the main square
from the exit above,

1061
01:28:15.707 --> 01:28:17.667
you'll have to cross the field some,

1062
01:28:17.793 --> 01:28:21.379
so if you follow me,
be ready to be killed by a mob at first sight.

1063
01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:38.647
<i>Sorry. The reason you're in this situation
in the first place...</i>

1064
01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:42.818
<i>In other words,
what drove you into the corner...</i>

1065
01:28:42.943 --> 01:28:44.820
<i>In a sense, it's my—</i>

1066
01:28:55.872 --> 01:28:57.165
Asuna!

1067
01:28:57.541 --> 01:28:58.750
Mito?

1068
01:29:00.502 --> 01:29:01.586
Um...

1069
01:29:06.216 --> 01:29:08.051
I'm going after him.

1070
01:29:10.262 --> 01:29:11.012
I've found it.

1071
01:29:11.763 --> 01:29:16.017
How I'm going to live in this world—
it's where he goes.

1072
01:29:16.726 --> 01:29:19.271
So I'm going to move forward.

1073
01:29:22.232 --> 01:29:24.192
All right, see you later.

1074
01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:32.617
Goodbye, Asuna.

1075
01:30:18.663 --> 01:30:20.665
I told you not to come.

1076
01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:24.586
No, you didn't. "If you're coming,
be ready to die"—that's what you said.

1077
01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:26.755
Did I really?

1078
01:30:29.716 --> 01:30:31.092
So beautiful.

1079
01:30:32.302 --> 01:30:36.014
Come to think of it,
you called my name during that battle.

1080
01:30:36.556 --> 01:30:38.558
Sorry for using just your first name.

1081
01:30:38.934 --> 01:30:40.685
Or did I mess up the pronunciation?

1082
01:30:41.227 --> 01:30:42.354
Pronunciation?

1083
01:30:42.979 --> 01:30:46.232
Never mind that.
I never told you my name,

1084
01:30:46.358 --> 01:30:47.984
and you never told me yours!

1085
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:49.736
How did you find out?

1086
01:30:49.861 --> 01:30:51.947
Uh... huh? Wait...

1087
01:30:52.072 --> 01:30:54.616
Didn't you say you'd formed a party before?

1088
01:30:54.741 --> 01:30:56.159
Sure I have.

1089
01:30:56.785 --> 01:31:02.290
You can see another HP gauge below yours,
around here, right?

1090
01:31:02.415 --> 01:31:04.626
Isn't there something written under that?

1091
01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:05.794
Huh?

1092
01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:09.005
Moving your face will make
the gauge move, too.

1093
01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:12.217
Keep your face still,
and just move your eyes to the left.

1094
01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.137
Ki... ri... to...

1095
01:31:16.262 --> 01:31:19.224
Kirito? Is that your name?

1096
01:31:19.349 --> 01:31:20.141
Yeah.

1097
01:31:20.266 --> 01:31:23.770
Oh, so it was written there all this time!

1098
01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.855
Oh! Uh... um...

1099
01:31:26.106 --> 01:31:28.400
I'm glad you were able to check that out.

1100
01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:35.657
The truth is, I came after you because
I wanted to thank you.

1101
01:31:35.782 --> 01:31:37.158
For the cream bun and the bath?

1102
01:31:37.283 --> 01:31:38.702
No, not that!

1103
01:31:40.537 --> 01:31:42.122
Well, I guess that's part of it, too.

1104
01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:47.419
Right... all kinds of things.
I want to thank you for so many things.

1105
01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:53.133
For the first time,
I've found something to strive for—

1106
01:31:53.258 --> 01:31:55.093
Something I want to chase after.

1107
01:31:55.218 --> 01:31:57.429
Really? What is it?

1108
01:31:57.554 --> 01:31:58.555
That's a secret.

1109
01:31:59.305 --> 01:32:00.724
I'm going to give it my all.

1110
01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:03.935
Do my best to survive,
and become stronger.

1111
01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:06.479
So that I can get to the place I'm striving for.

1112
01:32:09.441 --> 01:32:12.027
Yeah. You can become stronger.

1113
01:32:12.152 --> 01:32:14.195
Not just your sword skills.

1114
01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:17.949
You can find a strength that's even greater
and more valuable.

1115
01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:22.787
That reminds me,
there's one more thing that I need to tell you, right?

1116
01:32:22.912 --> 01:32:25.665
What I started to say last night...

1117
01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:29.085
No need. I understand now.

1118
01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:30.670
The path that you've walked till now.

1119
01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:34.924
And the place you're about
to walk towards on your own.

1120
01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:39.971
So... I'm going, too.

1121
01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:44.142
Let's go, Asuna.

1122
01:32:46.352 --> 01:32:48.772
Right, Kirito!

1123
01:32:58.323 --> 01:33:02.327
So those two are the top players at this point?

1124
01:33:02.994 --> 01:33:04.954
Now this should be interesting!

1125
01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:33.149
<i>Tangled, my thoughts are tangled in
a jumbled mess as I untie my hair</i>

1126
01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:34.734
<i>"You're not acting like yourself”</i>

1127
01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:42.659
<i>I won't smile for a portrait of me
drawn by somebody else</i>

1128
01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:47.664
<i>The definition of what
is right will keep on changing</i>

1129
01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:52.127
<i>But there's one thing I believe in
It's the thrill I feel in my heart</i>

1130
01:33:52.252 --> 01:33:54.129
<i>I just tell myself, "Go, go!"</i>

1131
01:33:54.254 --> 01:33:57.507
<i>70 a place where no one can reach me</i>

1132
01:33:57.632 --> 01:34:02.804
<i>Step on the gas
There's no time to think about fate</i>

1133
01:34:02.929 --> 01:34:04.681
<i>This is me, right here, right now</i>

1134
01:34:04.806 --> 01:34:09.310
<i>Yeah, there's a future to reach after
those days filled with tears</i>

1135
01:34:09.435 --> 01:34:13.189
<i>Heading for tomorrow
The world is a kaleidoscope</i>

1136
01:34:19.904 --> 01:34:29.164
<i>Bottled-up feelings
Let's dance even the signals of loneliness away</i>

1137
01:34:29.289 --> 01:34:30.665
<i>Nothing's wrong</i>

1138
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:35.837
<i>Those empty nights and fearful days</i>

1139
01:34:35.962 --> 01:34:38.673
<i>All are a part of me</i>

1140
01:34:38.798 --> 01:34:46.347
<i>Feeling lost and betrayed
When my pent-up emotions explode</i>

1141
01:34:46.472 --> 01:34:48.850
<i>What will I have left?</i>

1142
01:34:48.975 --> 01:34:51.686
<i>Yeah
While I'm shouting, "I'm here”</i>

1143
01:34:51.811 --> 01:34:54.314
<i>While I'm wishing, "Please love me"”</i>

1144
01:34:54.439 --> 01:34:58.818
<i>All I can do is keep running down
the road that I've chosen</i>

1145
01:34:58.943 --> 01:35:00.737
<i>I just tell myself, "Go, go!"</i>

1146
01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:04.115
<i>70 a place where no one can reach me</i>

1147
01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:09.495
<i>Overtaking turbulence,
I want to see a part of me that I don't even know</i>

1148
01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:11.372
<i>This is me, right here, right now</i>

1149
01:35:11.497 --> 01:35:16.002
<i>Yeah, I want to make the future
that I envisioned a reality</i>

1150
01:35:16.127 --> 01:35:19.255
<i>And I won't blame anyone else</i>

1151
01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:27.764
<i>You were always such a coward
but you've pretended that you didn't know</i>

1152
01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:29.349
<i>"I'm not in pain”</i>

1153
01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:34.520
<i>While protecting what's dear to you
While smiling and saying, "I'm okay"</i>

1154
01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:40.652
<i>You cried and said, "I want to change”</i>

1155
01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:47.158
<i>"I'm sorry" has finally become an inaudible echo</i>

1156
01:35:47.283 --> 01:35:52.664
<i>Transcending time,
I am no longer there</i>

1157
01:35:52.789 --> 01:36:01.005
<i>"Just leave it!" Yeah, I'm so in the present
moment that I have no time to reminisce</i>

1158
01:36:03.258 --> 01:36:05.510
